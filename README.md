This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating the common programming error of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug.java file shows the erroneous code, while the bugSolution.java file provides the corrected version. The error arises from an off-by-one error in the loop condition, causing an attempt to access an element beyond the array's allocated size.  The solution corrects the loop condition to prevent this error.
